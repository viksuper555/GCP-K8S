# ${UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER} in this file should be replaced manually!
# It is used only for namespace configuration (in other word this will be the namespace of your deployment)!
# It doesn't have to be the same as the one defined in "im.sh" and "deploy.sh" - other value can be chosen,
# but for simplicity, I would advise on using the same value.
